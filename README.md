### Hi, I'm a Senior PHP Developer ðŸ‘‹ 

The Programming and Computer Science are my passions. I'm a Web Application Developer with over 6 years of experience. Enthusiast on clean, modular and components architecture, focused on make software design more understandable, maintainable, scalable, robust, and last and not least testable. Applying design patterns, SOLID principles and good practices, making the code not only to compile.

I love collaborating with open source, keep me update with the community tendencies, writing technical articles, make personal projects and participating in hackathons or any type of challenges.
